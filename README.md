# Galaxy Engine

Galaxy Engine is a project made for learning purposes by [NarcisCalin](https://github.com/NarcisCalin). It is made with C++ and it uses the [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) library.

Special thanks to [Crisosphinx](https://github.com/crisosphinx) for helping me improve my code.

Special thanks to [SergioCelso](https://github.com/SCelso) for making the learning process a little easier and also for helping me implement the initial version of the Barnes-Hut quadtree.
